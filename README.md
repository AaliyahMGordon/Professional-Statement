# Professional-Statement

In technical support roles, I have taken complex technical details and translated them into clear and direct instructions for customers and team members alike.With this experience I am able to  effectively communicate cyber security protocols so all stakeholders (and team members) understand and follow best practices. Resolving complicated issues under pressure was a no brainer. Whether faulty network connection or software glitch, there was always a way to conclude and restore operationsâ€” tools I would apply graciously to identifying and remediating threats, vulnerabilities, and breaches in a cyber security environment.
