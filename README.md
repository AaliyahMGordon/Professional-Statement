# Professional-Statement

In technical support roles, I have taken complex technical details and translated them into clear and direct instructions for customers and team members alike.With this experience I am able to  effectively communicate cyber security protocols so all stakeholders (and team members) understand and follow best practices. Resolving complicated issues under pressure was a no brainer. And that is what intrests me most about the cybersecurity field, its capability to do things that most will not have the opportunity to participate in. There was always a way to conclude and restore operationsâ€” tools I would apply graciously to identifying and remediating threats, vulnerabilities, and breaches in a cyber security environment. My out of the box thinking can bring a ton of new innovative results to any complex situation!
